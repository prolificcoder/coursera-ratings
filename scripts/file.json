    about_the_course: "<b></b> <div><b></b>Spiritual sequel to Peter Thiel's <a href=http://blakemasters.tumblr.com/peter-thiels-cs183-startup>CS183</a> course on startups. Bridges the gap between academic computer science and production softwar<b></b>e engineering. Fast-paced introduction to key tools and techniques (command line, dotfiles, text editor, distributed version control, debugging, testing, documentation, reading code, deployments), featuring guest appearances by senior engineers from successful startups and large-scale academic projects. Over the course of the class, students will build a command line application, expose it as a web service, and then link other students' applications and services together to build an HTML5 mobile app. General principles are illustrated through modern Javascript and the latest web technologies, including Node, Backbone, Coffeescript, Bootstrap, Git, and Github.&nbsp;<b></b><b></b><b></b> </div>",
